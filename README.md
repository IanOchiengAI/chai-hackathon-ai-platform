# AI Mentorship Platform for Youth Educated (CHAI Hackathon)

This repository contains the AI components for the Youth Educated mentorship matching platform, built for the 2025 CHAI Hackathon.

## üöÄ Project Goal

To build a web-based platform that uses an AI recommendation engine to intelligently match mentees with suitable mentors, and provides a dashboard to track the program's impact.

## AI Components

This repository contains two core AI components:

1.  **The Matching Engine (`/src/matching_engine`):** A Python script that uses content-based filtering (Cosine Similarity) to recommend mentors to mentees based on their profiles.
2.  **The Impact Dashboard (`/src/dashboard`):** A Streamlit application that provides a real-time, visual overview of the platform's data and key metrics.
